# Laptop Setup Script

Thoughtbot's [Ruby guide to Mac OSX development](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/8700977975/2011-rubyists-guide-to-a-mac-os-x-development) inspired me to create my own set of scripts to install all the common tools I use for development (and in general). This really only applies for when setting up a new Mac but since I wanted to document what tools I installed anyway I loved how easy it is to do that all programmatically using bash.
