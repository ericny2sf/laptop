# Laptop Setup Script

Thoughtbot's [Ruby guide to Mac OSX development](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/8700977975/2011-rubyists-guide-to-a-mac-os-x-development) inspired me to create my own set of scripts to install all the common tools I use for development (and in general). This really only applies for when setting up a new Mac but since I wanted to document what tools I installed anyway I loved how easy it is to do that all programmatically using bash.

## Installation

 * Run Software Update
 * Install [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
 * Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
 * Install [Things for Mac](http://culturedcode.com/things/)
 * Install purchased apps from Mac App Store
 * [Install Xcode](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) or [CLI tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/). Seems for Node.js it is best to install Xcode as for some reason it binds to CoreData.
 * Start Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads -> Install command line tools
 * `git clone https://github.com/javierjulio/laptop.git ~/Projects/laptop && cd ~/Projects/laptop && ./laptop`
 * Install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
 * Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
 * Install [IE9-10 Virtual Machines](https://github.com/xdissent/ievms)
